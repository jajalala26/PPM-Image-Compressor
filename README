Architecture: Arith is composed of a driver 40image.c, compression and 
              decompression files compress.c and decompress.c and
              their respective header files, a file for the structs used
              by compress.c and decompress.c, and a file for bitpacking
              functions bitpack.c. The driver for arith calls the
              compression and decompression functions according to the input 
              that it recieves, and the compression and decompression 
              functions may rely on the structs and bitpacking functions.
              Additionally, the Hanson library is used for key opperations 
              that deal with allocating and freeing memory, as well as making
              assertions. Lastly, the key data structures UArray2b_T and 
              UArray2_T and their methods were given to us by the CS40 Solutions
              to Locality, and they rely on the Hanson library for UArray_T.
